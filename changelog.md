## Features

- Improved compilation, now there is no need to edit setup.py/xml files for your GPU/CUDA SDK
- Unify source: there is only one folder with all the CUDA code for both python and MATLAB. 
- Detector rotation now supported on parallel beam
- Add NikonDataLoader() to python
## BugFix

- Fix bug where compute 5.0 was not being compiled in python
- Some arbitrary rotation angles were not being passed to the kernel 
- Reduced memory needed in MATLAB NikonDataLoader
- MAyor bug that impedes many iterative algorithms to work in python. The way order_subsets returns arrays changed, now they are not dtype=object, but dtype=float
